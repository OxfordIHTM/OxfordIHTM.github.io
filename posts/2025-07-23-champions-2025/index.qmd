In mid-October 2024, Proochista Ariana [announced the Oxford iHealth Champions programme](https://oxford-ihtm.io/posts/2024-10-26-it-takes-a-village/) - a re-brand of earlier efforts to encourage and support community-building among our Oxford IHTM alumni towards continued learning, collaboration, and impactful action along the lines of open and reproducible science.

Nine months on, we are happy to welcome our latest batch of [iHealth Champions](https://oxford-ihtm.io/champions/) from [Oxford IHTM Class of 2025](https://oxford-ihtm.io/posts/2024-10-03-welcome-class-2025/). Today, each one received their **Knowledge Badge** and their **Champions Badge** after satisfactory completion of the [Open and Reproducible Science in R](https://oxford-ihtm.io/teaching/) module and the optional data concepts and applications sessions.
