## Oxford iHealth Champions onboarding

To generate more interest in the Oxford iHealth Champions programme among our alumni, we're going to hold our first series of Champions onboarding sessions. in August 2025. These sessions are aimed not only for the latest batch of Champions but also for previous batches who have not had an onboarding session.

To read more about the Champions onboarding sessions and how to register, see this [blog post](../../posts/2025-07-27-champions-onboarding/index.qmd).

## Waiting for orchid

We are keenly awaiting the arrival of **orchid** - our first compute server/workstation capable of running large language models (LLMs) efficiently. This resource is part of Oxford IHTMâ€™s efforts to support its current students and its alumni in learning and applying modern tools for global health projects. Specifically, this machine will provide support for and teaching on application of computational sciences to existing global health challenges.

We are planning our first quarterly community call sometime around October 2025. We have some ideas of topics to focus on including a presentation on our plans and actions for high-performance computing resources for our students and alumni and the requisite tools and skills needed to be able to access these resources. If you have any ideas for topics you want covered in our first community call, please let us know in our community call channel on Zulip or via our [contacts page](../../contact.qmd).
