[Laws.Africa](https://laws.africa) endeavours to facilitate African governments in offering sustainable, free access to dependable digital laws. It aims to achieve this by ensuring that the laws are easily accessible, user-friendly, educational, and reusable. This initiative seeks to empower citizens with knowledge of their legal rights and obligations while promoting transparency and accountability within the legal system. Laws.Africa offers a content application programming interface (API) to fetch legislative content and metadata. The API is a read-only API for listing and fetching published versions of legislative works. This package interfaces with this API to allow access using R.
