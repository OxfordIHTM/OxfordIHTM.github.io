The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) tracks and compares worldwide government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic rigorously and consistently. OxCGRT makes available systematic information in a consistent way, aiding those who require information have access to it efficiently for their purposes. This package facilitates access to the OxCGRT data via its [API](https://covidtracker.bsg.ox.ac.uk) and includes functions to calculate the various OxCGRT indices in R.

For more information on the `{oxcgrt}` package, you can visit the [project website](https://oxford-ihtm.io/oxcgrt/). To learn about the underlying code for this software development project, see the [GitHub code repository](https://github.com/OxfordIHTM/oxcgrt).
