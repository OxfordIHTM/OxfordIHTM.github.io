The [International Classification of Diseases (ICD)](https://www.who.int/standards/classifications/classification-of-diseases) serves a broad range of uses globally and provides critical knowledge on the extent, causes and consequences of human disease and death worldwide via data that is reported and coded with the ICD. [ICD API](https://icd.who.int/icdapi) allows programmatic access to the ICD. It is an HTTP based REST API. This package provides functions that interface with the ICD API.
