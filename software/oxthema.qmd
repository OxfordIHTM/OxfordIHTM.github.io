`{oxthema}` aims to provide templates, themes, and theme components for colour palettes, typography, and layout compliant with [University of Oxford](https://ox.ac.uk)â€™s visual identity guidelines for use in the [R](https://r-project.org) language for statistical computing graphics and publishing ecosystem.

The package provides colours, palettes, and fonts consistent with the university visual identity guidelines. The package also includes themes for specific packages and functionalities that make use of colours, palettes, and fonts. The package currently has themes for `{ggplot2}` and for `{forestploter}` packages.

`{oxthema}` is currently in pre-release (alpha release) to allow for alpha testing of current functionalities.
