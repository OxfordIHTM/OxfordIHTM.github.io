The Oxford IHTM CodeHub is an initiative of the [MSc in International Health and Tropical Medicine](https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/study-with-us/msc-ihtm){target="_blank"}. It serves as a focal point within the course for fostering innovation, research, and education in the field of computational sciences for health.

The CodeHub is designed to provide IHTM students with a learning environment for open and reproducible science and its enabling tools and technologies. Through various data and coding projects and the course's [research placement programme](https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/study-with-us/msc-ihtm/ihtm-research-placements){target="_blank"}, students are then able to leverage this learning in research, design, and development of possible solutions to complex challenges in global health.

This initiative also facilitates interdisciplinary collaboration, enabling participants from different fields to work together on innovative projects that can have a real-world impact on global health.
