title: "Session 5: Creating basic R workflows and literate programming"
subtitle: Basics of project-oriented workflows
---

In this session, the students will be taught and guided through creating basic R workflows with a focus on using a project-oriented approach in building scientific analysis workflows. The students will then be introduced to literate programming in R and the tools, packages, and techniques used to convert raw code workflows into those that combine content and data analysis code.
