title: "Open Science and Reproducible Research in R"
---

The **Open Science and Reproducible Research in R** module of the [MSc in International Health and Tropical Medicine](https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/study-with-us/msc-ihtm){target="_blank"} is designed to equip students with the skills and knowledge necessary to conduct research that is transparent, [reproducible](https://book.the-turing-way.org/){target="_blank"}, and in line with the principles of [open science](https://www.unesco.org/en/open-science){target="_blank"}.

The module website can be found [here](https://oxford-ihtm.io/open-reproducible-science){target="_blank"}. The website makes available session information and session slides.

<!-- ## Key Features of the Module -->

<!-- 1.  **Introduction to Open Science** -->

<!-- -   The module begins by introducing the concepts and principles of open science, including the importance of transparency, accessibility, and collaboration in research. -->

<!-- -   Students learn about the benefits of open science practices, such as increased credibility, easier collaboration, and enhanced reproducibility of research findings. -->

<!-- 2.  **Reproducibility in Research** -->

<!-- -   A significant focus of the module is on reproducibility, which refers to the ability of researchers to replicate the results of a study using the same data and methods. -->

<!-- -   Students are taught the principles of reproducible research and the best practices on how to ensure their findings can be reproduced by others. -->

<!-- 3.  **Data Management and Documentation** -->

<!-- -   Proper data management is crucial for reproducible research. The module covers best practices for organizing, documenting, and sharing research data. -->

<!-- -   Students learn about version control systems (e.g., Git) and how to use them to track changes in their data and code. -->

<!-- 4.  **Introduction to R** -->

<!-- -   The module introduces students to the [R](https://www.r-project.org/), a programming language widely used for statistical analysis and data visualisation. -->

<!-- -   Through hands-on exercises, students learn how to use R for data wrangling, analysis, and visualisation.. -->

<!-- 5.  **Reproducible Workflows in R** -->

<!-- -   Students learn how to create reproducible workflows in R using tools like RMarkdown, which allows them to integrate text, code, and output into a single document. -->

<!-- -   The module emphasizes the importance of automating analyses to reduce errors and ensure that research can be easily updated or reproduced. -->

<!-- 6.  **Collaboration and Sharing** -->

<!-- -   The module also covers tools and platforms that facilitate collaboration and sharing in open science, such as [GitHub](https://github.com), [Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://osf.io/), and other repositories. -->

<!-- -   Students are encouraged to share their code, data, and research outputs openly to contribute to the global scientific community. -->

<!-- 7.  **Ethical Considerations** -->

<!-- -   Ethical aspects of open science and reproducible research are discussed, including issues related to data privacy, intellectual property, and the responsible conduct of research. -->

<!-- 8.  **Application to Global Health and Tropical Medicine** -->

<!-- -   Throughout the module, there is an emphasis on applying open science and reproducible research practices to the field of global health and tropical medicine. -->

<!-- -   Students learn how these practices can enhance the quality and impact of research in these areas, particularly in low-resource settings. -->
