The **Open and Reproducible ScienceÂ· in R** module of the [MSc in International Health and Tropical Medicine](https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/study-with-us/msc-ihtm){target="_blank"} is designed to equip students with a foundational understanding and appreciation of the pillars of [Open Science](https://www.unesco.org/en/open-science){target="_blank"} more broadly and within that the concepts, methods and tools for [Reproducible Research](https://book.the-turing-way.org/){target="_blank"} more specifically. To further the students' learning, practical examples and exercises are discussed and walked through using the [R](https://cran.r-project.org){target="_blank"} language for statistical computing as a way to practically demonstrate these concepts.

## Module organisation

The module is organised in two parts. The first part focuses on teaching the basics of using R and RStudio. These topics are covered in the first 5 sessions of the module during Michealmas term. The second part, discussed in the last 5 sesions of the module during Hilary Term, focuses on giving on overview of open and reproducible science.
