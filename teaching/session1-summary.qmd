Using the right tools for the job is critical for success in any endeavour. In scientific research, specifically with scientific analysis, R is widely used by researchers from diverse disciplines  and by teachers of statistics and research methods. One of the most powerful characteristics of R is that it is open-source, meaning anyone can access the underlying code used to run the program and add their own code for free. Along with R, other tools facilitate/potentiate the benefits of using R.

In this session, we will introduce a basic set of tools that maximises the effectiveness of R for scientific research. Students will be given a basic introduction to [R](https://cran.r-project.org){target="_blank"}, [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/){target="_blank"}, and to [git](https://git-scm.com/){target="_blank"} and [GitHub](https://github.com){target="_blank"}. The students will also be guided and facilitated in installing and setting up each of these tools in the way that is considered best practice for scientific research purposes.
