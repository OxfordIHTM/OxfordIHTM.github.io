    "section": "Part 1: All about R",
    "text": "Part 1: All about R\nR is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as a different implementation of S. There are some important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered under R.\nR provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, etc.) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. The S language is often the vehicle of choice for research in statistical methodology, and R provides an Open Source route to participation in that activity.\nOne of R’s strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed. Great care has been taken over the defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, but the user retains full control.\nR is available as Free Software under the terms of the Free Software Foundation’s GNU General Public License in source code form. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms and similar systems (including FreeBSD and Linux), Windows and MacOS.\nR is unique in that it is not general-purpose. It does not compromise by trying to do a lot of things. It does a few things very well, mainly statistical analysis and data visualization. While you can find data analysis and machine learning libraries for languages like Python, R has many statistical functionalities built into its core. No third-party libraries are needed for much of the core data analysis you can do with the language.\nBut even with this specific use case, it is used in every industry you can think of because a modern business runs on data. Using past data, data scientists and data analysts can determine the health of a business and give business leaders actionable insights into the future of their company.\nJust because R is specifically used for statistical analysis and data visualization doesn’t mean its use is limited. It’s actually quite popular, ranking 12th in the TIOBE index of the most popular programming languages.\nAcademics, scientists, and researchers use R to analyze the results of experiments. In addition, businesses of all sizes and in every industry use it to extract insights from the increasing amount of daily data they generate.\n\nSession 1: Getting the right tools for the job\nUsing the right tools for the job is critical for success in any endeavour. In scientific research, specifically with scientific analysis, R is widely used by researchers from diverse disciplines to estimate and display results and by teachers of statistics and research methods. One of the most powerful characteristics of R is that it is open-source, meaning anyone can access the underlying code used to run the program and add their own code for free. Along with R, other tools facilitate/potentiate the benefits of using R.\nIn this session, we will introduce a basic set of tools that maximises the effectiveness of R for scientific research. Students will be given a basic introduction to R, RStudio, and to git and GitHub. The students will also be guided and facilitated in installing and setting up each of these tools in the way that is considered best practice for scientific research purposes.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nGrolemund G.

Reproducible research means that research data and code are made available so that others are able to reach the same results as are claimed in scientific outputs. Closely related is the concept of replicability, the act of repeating a scientific methodology to reach similar conclusions. These concepts are core elements of empirical research.\nThis lecture series is designed to give Oxford IHTM students a foundational understanding and appreciation of the pillars of Open Science more broadly and within that the concepts, methods and tools for Reproducible Research more specifically. To further the students’ learning, practical examples and exercises will be discussed and walked through using the R language for statistical computing as a way to practically demonstrate these concepts.\n\nSession 6: Open Science and Reproducible Research in R: An Overview\nIn this session, an overview of the what, why, and how of Open Science and Reproducible Research will be discussed to provide the learners with foundational understanding and appreciation of these concepts and their applications.\n\nFurther Reading\nRick, Jessica & Alston, Jesse.
