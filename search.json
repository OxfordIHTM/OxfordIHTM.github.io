    "text": "Key Features of the Module\n\nIntroduction to Open Science\nThe module begins by introducing the concepts and principles of open science, including the importance of transparency, accessibility, and collaboration in research. Students learn about the benefits of open science practices, such as increased credibility, easier collaboration, and enhanced reproducibility of research findings.\n\n\nReproducibility in Research\nA significant focus of the module is on reproducibility, which refers to the ability of researchers to replicate the results of a study using the same data and methods. Students are taught the principles of reproducible research and the best practices on how to ensure their findings can be reproduced by others.\n\n\nData Management and Documentation\nProper data management is crucial for reproducible research. The module covers best practices for organizing, documenting, and sharing research data. Students learn about version control systems (e.g., Git) and how to use them to track changes in their data and code.\n\n\nIntroduction to R\nThe module introduces students to the R, a programming language widely used for statistical analysis and data visualisation Through hands-on exercises, students learn how to use R for data wrangling, analysis, and visualisation..\n\n\nReproducible Workflows in R\nStudents learn how to create reproducible workflows in R using tools like RMarkdown, which allows them to integrate text, code, and output into a single document. The module emphasizes the importance of automating analyses to reduce errors and ensure that research can be easily updated or reproduced.\n\n\nCollaboration and Sharing\nThe module also covers tools and platforms that facilitate collaboration and sharing in open science, such as GitHub, Open Science Framework (OSF), Zenodo, Figshare, and other repositories. Students are encouraged to share their code, data, and research outputs openly to contribute to the global scientific community.\n\n\nEthical Considerations\nEthical aspects of open science and reproducible research are discussed, including issues related to data privacy, intellectual property, and the responsible conduct of research.\n\n\nApplication to Global Health and Tropical Medicine\nThroughout the module, there is an emphasis on applying open science and reproducible research practices to the field of global health and tropical medicine. Students learn how these practices can enhance the quality and impact of research in these areas, particularly in low-resource settings."
